### Execute the project

```
1. Fork the original repository to your own repository or Download the binary
2. Clone it to your local
3. In the main project folder run make
4. In the shell: ./clusterapp filelist.txt 3
```
Obs.: `filelist and 3 are arguments to execute the code. Where: 3 means number of clusters represented by K`
